				<h1 id="0">Ethical Shopper</h1>
				<p class="tags">#ecommerce #responsivedesign #branding #ethicalshopping #workflow #concept</p>
				<p class="intro">Ethical Shopper is a project where I combined my design skills with my love for animals, equality and the environment, exploring the use of design to influence consumer behavior.</p>

				<h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
				<p>Ethical Shopper is based on a course project where we were asked to design an ecommerce shopping experience. I worked independently while meeting with my mentor on a weekly basis. My focus of this project was to design the overall e-commerce framework, but specifically focusing on the user stories defined. The project took 3 weeks from start to finish, roughly 150 hrs in total.</p>
				
				<h2 id="1">The Problem</h2>
				<p>With the rise in popularity of minimalism, more and more people started to become conscious about what they bring into their lives. In this process of being more conscious, it is common for one to become more interested about different aspects of the product: how long it will last, how it was made, how the materials were sourced, and what are its environmental impact at disposal. An average consumer may not consider all of these factors when they are buying a shirt, but at the end of the day, people want to feel good about their purchase, they want to know that not only the piece of fashion item makes them look good and
				will last for a long time, it is even better if their purchase is aligned with their values.</p>

				<p>I have caught myself with the following dilemma, what makes something ethical? A $10 dollar t-shirt from fast fashion retailers may not pay fair wage to the workers as they rip high profits, but the shirt is vegan! A $300 bag may be fair-trade, but they use leather in their product which makes the product neither vegan, and not necessarily cruelty free. How can a conscious consumer make the best decision in the ethical aspect, and how can retailers help in the design of their site? This is an additional problem that I wanted to address in this ecommerce design project.</p>
				
				<h2 id="2">The Process</h2>
				<p>I started the project by writing a design brief and setting my intentions for this project, then narrowing down the scope of the project by listing out the user stories so that I know I have covered the key functionalities and would be able to focus on what is most important. Then for each user story I created variations of low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq in order to quickly brainstorm different layout ideas before choosing the best one for hi-fidelity design. During the process I prototyped twice to get peer feedback and two user testing to make sure the design satisfies the user goals. For the final prototype I used Flinto which allowed me to create more detailed interactions that makes the design more effective.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				<h3 id="3">User Stories</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>As a user, I want to browse products</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to quickly understand where each product stands in terms of the ethical criteria</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to view details about a specific product</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to view ratings and reviews for a product</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to add a product to my cart</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to pay for my items with a credit card, Amazon Payments or PayPal</li>
					<li>As a user, I want to sign up for an account</li>

				</ul>
				<h3 id="4">Research</h3>
				<p>I selected a few online stores from low to high end such as Everlane, Patagonia, Aritzia to see learn how they currently handle browsing, product detail, and their checkout process to learn what works well, what needs improvement so that in my design I can learn from what works and avoid what doesn’t. For example, Everlane and Aritzia has a visually appealing, easy to navigate product detail page, with large product image and clear product information, while it was easy to look through all the image by dual panel scrolling.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				
				<h2 id="5">Design, Feedback and Testing</h3>

				<h3 id="6">Browse Products</h3>
				<p>The goal of this user story is to clearly present the product categories, show summary of product info such as name, price and a quick way to show the ethical criteria.</p>
				<p>Ethical Criteria - In order to clearly show whether a product meets various ethical criteria, first I needed to identify what those criteria are. I narrowed it down to 4: vegan, cruelty-free, fairtrade and eco-friendliness. The four criteria can exist independently except that vegan products are a subset of cruelty free products.  To make things even simpler I used icons to represent each of the four ethical criterion.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				<p>This is the first iteration where I try to come up with the overall site architecture, i.e. where the nav goes, the search and filter functionalities, as well as clearly defining what are each of the ethical criteria.</p>
				<p>While doing a quick research how other online retailers structure their site, I saw that having an additional side navigation that quickly takes the user to a different product category was common in fast fashion retailers, but I decided against it because it would distract the browsing experience the current category.</p>
				<p>I also played around with the idea of having a legend for the different ethical indicators because I wanted it to be clear what those symbols meant, but I also didn’t want the ethical indicators to overwhelm the site and distract from the shopping experience. So in the end I did not include the legend anywhere but rather used the home page to tell the story of Ethical Shopper (I will talk about the home page design later). If the user forget what the the icon meant, he/she can simply hover over it and be reminded with a tooltip.</p>
				<p>In the navigation, I also included shopping cart, sign-in/sign-up and search for quick access. Right below the navigation I included breadcrumbs to help orient the user, as well as an option to apply filter on their browsing results.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				<p>While translating the wireframes into designs, I had a few more ideas on the positions of the navigation and decided to do a preference test. My thought is that when browsing products on the desktop, we usually have enough horizontal real estate, but vertical real is limited and is made even more precious with a top navigation and filter bar. I created a variation with a left side and put the idea to a preference test. However, the test result revealed that none of the 16 participants liked the left navigation, and 95% liked the second option the best because of its visual simplicity and, I would guess familiarity? So I chose the 2nd variation as my overall site architecture. </p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">

				<h3 id="7">Product Detail Page</h3>
				<p>The objective of the product detail page was to be free of distractions, and make the information easily discoverable, and key actions such as “Add to Cart” and “Save for Later” should be readily available.</p>
				<p>Product images are no doubt the most important element in online shopping, especially for fashion, so I made sure at least half of the screen real estate are allocated to it. It is not evident here but I designed a dual panel scrolling behavior to browse through the product images because it is the easiest interaction.</p>
				<p>For writing a review for the product, I opted for a modal dialog so that the user does not need to navigate away from this page, and when the review is done, the dialog disappears leaving the user exactly where he/she left off and free to continue browsing.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">

				<h3 id="8">Checkout Process</h3>
				<p>The objectives of the checkout design was present the cart content, associated costs in a clear, readable manner, and making the payment process frictionless and forgiving (e.g. no account? No problem. Want to make a change at the last minute? No problem.)</p>
				<p>When designing the checkout process, I started by brainstorming the different check-out scenarios, specifically whether the user is signed in, and whether they have an account or not. For first time users, one is more likely to checkout as guest. This way I know what components I need to include in my design.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a first time user, I want to check out the items in my cart without signing up</li>
					<li>As a first time user, after I have checked out, I want to use the information I filled in already to create an account</li>
					<li>As a first time user, I want to quickly create an account via social sign-in so I don’t have to remember any password</li>
					<li>As a returning user, I want to login via email and password before checkout</li>
					<li>As a returning user, I want to login via social sign-in before checkout</li>

				</ul>
				<p>I always kept in mind to design for mobile first, in the case of e-commerce sites it is especially crucial because the site is so information heavy. Mobile first ensures that all the key information will fit and work on a small screen.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">

				<h3 id="9">Sign-In and Sign-Up</h3>
				<p>Regarding social sign-on, I created a survey to see what people’s preferences are regarding social sign-on, and found out there are quite a bit of dislikes around social authentication, mainly because people are afraid that websites will post stuff to their social media. However, 50% of the participants revealed that they have so many accounts with various online stores they don’t even know what they have. That is a lot of accounts, and passwords to remember. Therefore I decided to include social sign-on in my design, but address the worry of authorized or unauthorized posting to give the users a piece of mind.</p>
				<p>The sign-in and sign-up forms are used in various places, here it is used in “write a review” as well as the first step in the checkout process. I included a disclaimer accompanying the social sign-on buttons letting the user know that the site will not post anything.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">

				<h3 id="10">Home Page</h3>
				<p>The home page of this project was one that I had the most difficulties with, mainly because it is a fictitious site and I didn’t have any clear goals on what I want to achieve with the home page. So the first iterations was just some common elements that I saw in other online stores, such as best sellers, new arrival, and a banner legend explaining the ethical filters.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				<p>However, after testing the prototype with a few users, one of the feedback I got was that the narrative of the site is not clear: because the site’s focus on the ethical aspect of shopping, the audience expect and want to know how the products or the platform is different from other sites, and just exactly what the site is all about. I thought that the home page would be the perfect place to provide a clear first impression.</p>
				<p>I narrowed down the objective of the home page to be a simple introduction of what Ethical Shopper is about, but still providing the user a way to skip this introduction anytime he/she wants to get straight to the shopping.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				
				<h2 id="11">Final Design</h2>
				<p>I am quite happy with the design overall, although I added one more element to a site that is already information ridden in nature, the design looks clean and fresh, it is easy to navigate, thoughtful and delightful in interaction.</p>
				<img src="" class="placeholder">
				
				<h2 id="12">Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>The preference test on the site navigation came as a shocker to me, because what I thought was a touch of genius was not accepted by others at all. This made me realize that for functional products, people really enjoy the simple and the familiar.</p>
				<p>However, now ask I am writing this I doubt that this preference test is truly accurate. What would be a better test is to have two groups use the prototype to perform certain tasks, then ask them to rate how much they like the site design and layout. Since what people say they like is not always indicative of what they actually like.</p>
				<p>I skipped a crucial step in the very beginning which is defining what the store is. As you can see it is a pretty generic fashion retailer. One of the reason is because I knew that I wanted the store to feel mainstream as my intention was to design a site that makes ethical shopping as convenient and mainstream as any other high street fashion retailer. However it would have helped to flesh it out in more detail such as identifying what items it sells, its target audience etc. This caused me to go back and forth in many user stories such as the home page and product detail page because the goals were not clear.</p>
				<p>In addition, in this project I used Flinto to create various interactions in the site, the sliding in and out transitions, loading in between pages, which not only adds to the quality of the design but they have practical values too. For example the slide up transition for the mobile buttons make them more discoverable, the drop down effect of the filter makes its relationship with the rest of the page more clear.</p>
				
				<h2 id="13">Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>The product images are from J.Crew because they are my favorite store. This is a personal, experimental, project that is not for profit.</p>
